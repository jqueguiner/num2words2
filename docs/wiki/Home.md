# num2words2 Wiki

`num2words2` converts numbers into words for multilingual applications. It is a modern fork of `num2words` with broader locale coverage, active maintenance, sentence-level conversion helpers, currency handling, cheque formatting, fractions, and aviation/ICAO English phraseology.

The package is useful for text normalization, speech systems, LLM preprocessing, document generation, search indexing, and any workflow that needs stable human-readable numbers.

## Quick Example

```python
from num2words2 import num2words, num2words_sentence

num2words(42)
# 'forty-two'

num2words(42, lang="fr")
# 'quarante-deux'

num2words(42, to="ordinal")
# 'forty-second'

num2words(42.50, to="currency", currency="USD")
# 'forty-two dollars, fifty cents'

num2words("1/3")
# 'one third'

num2words_sentence("I bought 6 apples for $12.50.")
# 'I bought six apples for twelve dollars, fifty cents.'
```
