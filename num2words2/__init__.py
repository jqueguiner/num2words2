"""num2words2 — a thin Python binder over the Rust conversion core.

Every conversion, and every piece of presentation logic that used to live
here (language-code resolution, the ``style=`` post-processing, the ``cents=``
mode mapping and the whole type dispatch), is now served by the compiled
``_rust`` extension. This module is a pass-through: it re-exports the public
entry points and the exception types, nothing more.
